# Course Management System

The Course Management System is designed to allow a user to signup an login as a student who can select their courses.
The Course Management System can handle multiple accounts at once, each retaining whatever course information was assigned to them.

# Installation

If you wish to run this application yourself, download the exe and cpp files, and then run the exe file and enjoy

# Collaboration

This game was created as a school project, so it is not too advanced and could use some work in UI and have more use to it.
Because of this, if you wish to collaborate that would be greatly appreciated. 
Just fork this repository and make changes as you'd like, just please remember to give credit to me when using my work.
